<strong>About Us</strong><BR><br>

There are some key elements that we feel our clients are looking for in a general contractor: Expertise, Leadership and Trust. Expertise takes years to develop. It comes in many forms. Knowledge in your craft, basic knowledge across many trades and how to take that expertise to complete a project on time, on budget and of course, above and beyond the client’s expectations.<br><br>

Leadership is a skill that is the most important aspect of any entrepreneur. In contracting one must be able to wear many hats. Managing subcontractors, vendors, manufacturers and of course acting as the agent for the client is our utmost concern. Finally, Trust. The client is undertaking a huge step on one of their major investments. Many of our clients are absentee homeowners. We have been highly recommended to take on projects while the homeowner is out of town. We are in constant contact via email, Skype, phone calls, thus providing the confidence they are looking for as the project progresses. Bill Monroe, managing member of MFC Enterprises, LLC, has been in the Valley since 1959 and part of the general contracting world since 1980. With training in ironworks, carpentry and design, he has seen “Phoenix Rising”, literally.<br><br>

As a journeyman ironworker he was a key part of many of the high rises along the central corridor, both as new construction and more recently renovating entire buildings. Later in his career he began a career in the carpentry union. Combining the skills of ironworks and carpentry led to many projects, both commercial and residential helping to build Arizona one project at a time.<br><br>

His passion for design led him to Arizona State University where he majored in Architecture. Over the years CAD design has evolved from hand-drawn design to a simple click of the mouse. MFC Enterprises offers residential design services and estimating from small to large scale projects.<br><br>

Whether your needs are design, estimating, remodel, renovations or just advisement, MFC can provide your project with all the tools necessary.<br><br>

Let MFC Enterprises take your vision to reality with complete confidence.<br><br>
